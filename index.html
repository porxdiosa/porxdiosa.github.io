								<h3>awakening</h3>
								<p>
									most of my life has been experienced in extremes; events and infatuations crash and boom abruptly and quickly. but my love of decolonized care has been something of a slow burn… almost a lifelong induction process guided by both my ancestors and descendant.
								</p>
								<p>
									growing up in a caribbean family meant leaving cups of water beneath my bed to ward off pain; it meant curing colds with the magic of my yaya’s immaculate ajiaco. as a kid, i remember talking to trees &amp; swearing that they’d talk back. i felt most powerful among our planet’s greenest treasures. though i could not fully articulate what specifically i searched for, i indulged my insatiable curiosity for divine healing through experimenting &amp; muddling &amp; experimenting &amp;mixing &amp; offering.
								</p>
								<p>
									when my little diositx was born, i began thinking at a much more critical level about the substances we put in or on our bodies. tasked with the most holy of duties--motherhood--i became determined to protect my child from all within my control. i slowly realized how awfully unsustainable that practice can be for so many of us. so much of the food and products that we can fiscally access carry risks to our bodies. more affordable alternatives may require a level of labor we are just unable to do, proving to be equally unsustainable for our families.
 								</p>
 								<p>
 									becoming chronically ill myself led me deeper into the journey of healing &amp; care. i began to realize at the deepest level that my lack of access to treatments and foods that would be most beneficial for my body was a deliberate, violent act of capitalism &amp; white supremacy. unable to find relief from any medical professionals, i took matters into my own hands and decided to lean into the wisdom of my ancestors’ decolonized healing practices.
 								</p>
 								<p>
 									as a result, my love for herbs, plants, oils, and all the goodness that the earth provides has overflowed into POR DIOSA.
								</p>
								<h3>now</h3>
								<p>
								POR DIOSA is a range of absolutely natural, organic, unequivocally pure potions &amp; remedies designed to aid the decolonized femme in skin care/ soul care/ self care. my mission is to take back the healing gems that have been taken from our lands to empower everyone with access to their own care. every single item is created with love, passion, and maybe a little brujeria.
